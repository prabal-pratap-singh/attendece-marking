# attendece-marking
in this project there are to code file.
   1. main code file
   2. simple_facerec
# simple_facrec
in this file we are are reading  the image from our image file and encode all the image so that we can compare all the images from the file with the user face. 
# main code file:
in this we access the camera and then our second file simple_facerec is called and after that we compare the video that has been recorded by our main code file and find the face in it after that we compare the face with the images encoded and if its match then attendence is marked other wise you have to fill your name and roll_number and register yourself.

to compare faces i have use face_regonition library because i find it more accurate in comparing face.

i have created GUI by using TKinter.
